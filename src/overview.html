SensorBase-UH is the University of Hawaii "reference implementation" of the SensorBase service 
for Hackystat Version 8.0.  
<p>
Hackystat 8.0 implements a web service architecture in which individual services communicate
using REST principles.  For more information, see the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackystat/">Hackystat Version 8 Home Page</a>.  For access
to code, documentation, and other project materials on SensorBase-UH, please consult the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/">SensorBase-UH Home Page</a>.
<p>
The "SensorBase" is a low-level service in this architecture, which is responsible for:
<ul>
<li> Receiving low-level sensor data from "Sensor" services that are attached to various
tools in the developer environment. 
<li> Management of three forms of sensor "meta-data": Projects, Users, and SensorDataTypes.
<li> Persisting both data and meta-data in a database.
<li> Responding to requests for subsets of this sensor data and meta-data from higher level 
services. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/wiki/RestApiSpecification">
SensorBase REST API Specification</a> provides details on the form of 
web service requests and associated responses supported by this SensorBase.
</ul>
<p>
To accomplish these tasks, the SensorBase is organized into the following subpackages:
<ul>
<li> org.hackystat.sensorbase.resource, containing subpackages for the four
core resources in this system: SensorData, SensorDataTypes, Projects, and Users.
<li> org.hackystat.sensorbase.server, which implements the HTTP services for GET, PUT, POST,
and DELETE of the resources.
<li>org.hackystat.sensorbase.db, which implements the persistency layer.
<li>org.hackystat.sensorbase.logger, which implements a simple logging service. 
</ul>
<p>
This SensorBase uses the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> framework to support
its REST architectural style.
